            <article><h3>Crafty handworks</h3><p>Crafts encompass a wide range of creative activities that involve making handmade items, often using materials like
            paper, fabric, wood, or clay. These activities can include knitting, sewing, woodworking, pottery, and more. Crafts
            serve various purposes, from functional objects to decorative pieces, and can be both a hobby and a means of artistic
            expression. Engaging in crafts can also promote relaxation, mindfulness, and community connection, as many people share
            their skills and creations through workshops and social gatherings. Overall, crafts celebrate creativity and individual
            expression while often embracing traditional techniques and modern innovations.</p></article>
